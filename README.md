# Coughee

## App Description
Coughee™ is an app unlike no other. Here at Coughee™ we care about your health and want to support you in your day to day adventures by tracking your fuel intake. We take coffee shops local to Berkeley and allow users to choose the beverage they just purchased and provide them with the caffeine intake (in mg). We will track a user’s purchases and coffee shop visit history as well as total daily caffeine intake. All of this is in hopes of allowing our users to stay within the daily consumption recommendation as well as explore the rich coffee of the bay area.

Some more implementation will include: uploading your own caffeine intake to be more inclusive of other drinks such as Energy drinks or caffeine pills , viewing the store’s hours/google data , and awards; get badges for drinking more than your friends. It’s not an easy lifestyle and we want to commend you for your efforts.

## Timeline
1. Setup Firebase user authentication.
2. Setup Firebase database for posts and coffee shops.
3. Layout the basic UI/UX.
4. Implement MapKit and plot the coffee shop locations.
5. Use the Google Places API to fetch coffee shop info.
6. Iterate on the UI and install the necessary CocoaPods.

The work distribution is still work in progress, but we'll post updates to the README as we move forward.

**April 4th, 2018:** Firebase app setup.
